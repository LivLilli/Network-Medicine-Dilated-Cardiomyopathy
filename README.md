# Part 3 – Reporting

3.1) Summarize the following information in a short report which includes:

• very short intro (10 lines max) about the pathophysiological condition (the seed genes context) and, if any, issues with gene IDs 

• a table with seed genes information (point 1b; omit “protein description”) <b>ok</b> 

• a summary table of interaction data (point 2) <b>ok</b> 
 
• the 8 charts of the enrichment analysis from Enrichr (point 4) <b>ok</b> 

• a table with global measures of SGI, I, U, I-LCC, U-LCC <b>ok</b> 

• a figure of the SGI and of the I-LCC networks (do not forget figure captions) <b>ok</b> 

• a table with the first 20 highest ranking genes for betweenness (include in the table
also all other calculated centrality measures as from 1.2b) for I-LCC and U-LCC

• summary table of the putative disease modules found with each of the two clustering algorithms (for each module: no. of seed genes in each module, total no. of genes in each module, ratio no. seed genes/total genes in the module, p-value of the
enrichment using the hypergeometric test)

• the list of the first 30 genes identified by the DIAMOnD tool and charts from Enrichr.

• notes and comments on the method followed, discrepancies, lack of data, any other
point worth to be mentioned.

Notes: all tables and figures must have a caption (they must be self-consistent); a report template is provided.
