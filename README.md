>## Aim

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by ventricular dilatation and it is a cause of heart failure (HF) and cardiac transplantations. Our study consisted in exploring potential DCM-related genes and their underlying interactions. In particular our analysis was based on the observation of several ad hoc PPI interactomes, generated from manipulation of interactions data coming from BioGRID and IID databases. Our aim was to find significant correlations among these genes and our disease.

The project consisted in studying the interactions of genes somehow correlated to the Dilated Cardiomyopathy. In particular, we explored the DisGeNET database in order to find all the genes associated to the disease (i.e. seed genes), checking their symbols on HGNC. Then we used the UniProt database in order to find some additional information about the seed genes. Finally, we searched for their interactions on BioGRID and IID databases, building several ad hoc interactomes in order to make some enrichment analysis. At the end, from the interactomes we pass to the corresponding networks, doing an in-depth topological study.
